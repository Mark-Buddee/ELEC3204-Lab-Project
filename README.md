Dynamically control a real, small-scale, elevator. The elevator has multiple floors, a motor, and motor controller.

Dynamically remembers which floors need to be reached and always moves to the next closest desired floor.

A PID controller dictates the power to the motor, ensuring the correct acceleration/movement speed of the elevator, regardless of load size, or unexpected resistance or fluctuations in motor source-voltage.
